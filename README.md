### 1 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
original node value plus the sum of all node value greater than the original node value in BST (.sum) <br>
use .sum += node.val so we have sum value.  then node.val = .sum. we can get GST <br>
And .sum should be equal to current node value plus the sum of all node value greater than the current node value <br>
we need to determine all other node value and the current node value. so need traverse. <br>
BST have left node right node and root. think about order about it. how to read each node value? we can use recursion <br>
<br><br>

### 2 91. Decode Ways
first, if not 1-26 or is 0, should return 0. because 0 means nothing <br>
x = len, len is message <br>
how to divide? <br>

### 3 1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree


### 4 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II



### 5 1791. Find Center of Star Graph
there is only one center. <br>
so find the same number in each edge. <br>
but just need to compare the first two edge is enough. because each edge have center number <br>
compare edge[0, 0],to edge[1, 0] and edge [1, 1]. <br>
we can use if ...or ...    else... <br>
if 0 0 == 1 0 or 0 0 == 1 1 means 0 0 is center. return 0 0 <br>
else means 0 1 is center so return 0 1
<br><br>

### 6 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
we need to create a empty array. use Hashmap <br>
we have an unsorted array of integers nums. so first we need to order it. <br>
we need to use a for loop and while loop to determine that the adjacent numbers in the array differ only by 1 for whole nums. nums and nums - 1 <br>
for i in len(nums) <br>
and store the numbers in an empty array. Until the adjacent numbers do not differ by 1. <br>
so we will have many new array. we need to choose the biggest one. <br>
<br><br>

### 7 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads
first, traverse all country. determine which country connect the most roads. <br>
store it in an empty array. and order it(roads number). then give the biggest importance to the country have the most roads. <br>
now we have an ordered array (1,2,2,3,3). this is roads. <br>
and we distribute importance. it is (1,2,3,4,5). then we use roads times importanve. <br>
finally, add these 5 number which is the biggest importance <br>
<br><br>

### 8 141. Linked List Cycle
use a Hash map. create an empty array <br>
use head as current node. we can use while current:    array.add(current) <br>
then read next node. keep adding. so empty array will add a lot of node <br>
when the node is the end. currenr.next will the pos. if the pos in this hash set. return true <br>
else return false. <br>
* double pointer work, question!? <br>

### 9 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph
it is like leetcode 1791, but not find center <br>
reserve traverse all node. deternmine whether each node has a superior(end). if not, return [] <br>
if there are any superiors, determine how many superiors and names each node has <br>
<br><br>

### 10 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal
First, we can determine whether the numerator and denominator are 0. If the numerator is 0, 0 is returned directly. If the denominator is 0, it is meaningless. <br>
then calculate // and %, respectively, the integer part and the remainder part. <br>
<br><br>

### 12 169. Majority Element
sort the nums, and return the mid, becuz mid is the majority element <br>



### 13 1550. Three Consecutive Odds
use % to determine num in arr is even or odds. if num % 2 =0 is even, = 1 is odds <br>
use for loop to traverse arr. <br>
<br>

### 15 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II
use hash map<br>
create an empty array to store same number <br>
we can sort two nums array <br>


### 16 179. Largest Number
because it is int number, we need to arrange these numbers together. so we should change int to string <br>
and we need to compare the first digit size of a number <br>
if there is a 0 in string type, just put it in the end <br>
then reverse sort them <br>


### 17 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves
if there are 4 number, we can just return 0. because we can replace all number<br>
if more than 4 numbers, first, we need to use nums.sort() to sort all int in nums. <br>
